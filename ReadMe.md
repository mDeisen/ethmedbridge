## Introduction
Welcome to MedConnect, a middleware solution developed for the ETH Global Hackathon! MedConnect is a revolutionary platform that bridges medical default APIs, like Fire and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), with zk-gated blockchain technology. Our goal is to empower patients with secure access to their medical records and enable them to selectively disclose specific biomarkers to research institutions. By doing so, patients can participate in clinical trials, contribute to scientific advancements, and get rewarded for sharing their data.

## Features
- Seamless connection between medical default APIs and zk-gated blockchain.
- Patient-controlled access to their medical records and selective data disclosure.
- Doctor offices/hospitals can issue zk-gated medical marker NFTs after every examination.
- Patients can opt-in or opt-out for participation in research/clinical trials.
- Institutions can select eligible subsets of patients for study participation.
- Patients are incentivized and rewarded for revealing their medical records.

## How It Works
1. **Data Integration**: MedConnect integrates various medical default APIs, such as Fire and FHIR, to fetch medical records from different healthcare providers securely.

2. **zk-gated Blockchain**: MedConnect uses zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) technology to create a private and secure layer on top of the blockchain for storing sensitive medical data.

3. **Medical Marker NFTs**: Doctor offices/hospitals issue zk-gated medical marker NFTs to patients after each examination. These NFTs act as proofs of examination and contain specific medical data.

4. **Patient Consent**: Patients have full control over their medical data. They can opt-in or opt-out for participation in research/clinical trials using their MedConnect wallet.

5. **Data Querying**: Research institutions can query the zk-gated blockchain for specific medical markers to find eligible patients for their studies. However, the patient's identity remains anonymous.

6. **Incentives for Data Sharing**: When a patient matches the selected set of queries, they have the option to reveal their medical data, sign-up for study participation, and receive incentives for sharing their data.

## Technologies Used
- Ethereum Blockchain
- zk-SNARK (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge)
- Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- Web3.js
- Fire and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) APIs

## Getting Started
To run MedConnect locally and participate in the hackathon project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/medconnect.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the Ethereum provider and network settings in `truffle-config.js`.
4. Deploy smart contracts to your local blockchain: `truffle migrate`
5. Start the application: `npm start`

## Usage
1. Sign up for a MedConnect account as a patient or a research institution.
2. Doctor offices/hospitals issue zk-gated medical marker NFTs after conducting medical examinations.
3. Patients can log in to their MedConnect wallet to see their NFTs and decide whether to participate in research/clinical trials.
4. Research institutions can use their MedConnect account to create data queries and find eligible patients.
5. Patients who match the selected queries can choose to share their medical data, participate in the study, and get rewarded.
